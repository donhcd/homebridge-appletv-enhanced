        ### Hi!

        Before we start. Make sure that the question you are having is not a [support request](https://github.com/maxileith/homebridge-appletv-enhanced/issues/new?template=2-support_request.yml).

        **Do not** use this template just because the support request template asks for too much information. That's just lazy üòâ

    attributes:
      label: Preconditions
      options:
        - label: The support request template is not a better fit to my question
          required: true
